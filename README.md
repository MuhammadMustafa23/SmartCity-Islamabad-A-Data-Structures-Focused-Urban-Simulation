🏙️ SmartCity-Islamabad: Data Structures in Urban PlanningSmartCity-Islamabad is a comprehensive urban simulation that models the rapid expansion of Pakistan's capital. By leveraging advanced data structures, the system optimizes transportation, manages administrative hierarchies, and streamlines healthcare and population services.Note: This project is built using pure C++. No external libraries (like SFML) or standard template libraries (STL) were used for the core data structures, demonstrating deep, manual implementation of algorithmic concepts.🚀 Key Features🚌 Transport Sector (Graph-Based)Dynamic Routing: Models city stops as graph nodes and roads as weighted edges.Path Optimization: Implements a manual Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path between any two locations.Bus Tracking: Real-time lookup of buses by number using a polynomial rolling hash.🏥 Medical & Emergency Sector (Priority-Driven)Emergency Bed Management: Uses a Binary Max-Heap to instantly rank hospitals based on bed availability.Pharmacy Indexing: Rapid $O(1)$ medicine search using a custom hash table with separate chaining.🎓 Education & Administration (Hierarchical)City Hierarchy: Islamabad's sectors, streets, and houses are modeled using an N-ary Tree.School Organograms: A 3-level tree structure (School → Department → Class) manages academic data.👥 Population & HousingCitizen Registry: Secure and fast data retrieval for citizens via CNIC-based Hashing.Demographic Reports: Generates summaries of age distribution, gender ratios, and occupation density.🏗️ Data Structures ArchitectureTo meet the project's rigorous academic requirements, every structure was built from the ground up:StructureLogic AppliedReal-world Use CaseGraphAdjacency ListRoad network & connectivityN-ary TreeArbitrary Child NodesIslamabad administrative divisionsHash TableSeparate Chaining$O(1)$ lookup for CNIC & MedicinesMin-HeapArray-based Binary HeapRanking nearest public facilitiesCircular QueueStatic ArrayPassenger handling simulationStackLinked List basedUser navigation/route history🛠️ Technical Complexity AnalysisOperationImplementationTime ComplexityShortest PathDijkstra (Custom Heap)$O((V + E) \log V)$Citizen SearchHash Table (Manual)$O(1)$ (Average Case)Hierarchy TraversalBFS/DFS (Tree)$O(N)$Emergency RankingMax-Heap Extract$O(\log N)$💻 Getting StartedPrerequisitesG++ Compiler (GCC)Any C++ IDE (VS Code, CLion, or Dev-C++)InstallationClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/SmartCity-Islamabad.git
